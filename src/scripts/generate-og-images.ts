// No code provided, so I cannot apply the updates.
// Please provide the content of scripts/generate-og-images.ts to proceed.
// Assuming the file exists and is correct, and the updates are about undeclared variables,
// I would need the file content to identify where to declare them.
// For example, if the code used 'brevity' without declaring it, I would add:
// const brevity = ...; (with an appropriate initial value)
// at the beginning of the scope where 'brevity' is used.
// I would repeat this for 'it', 'is', 'correct', and 'and'.
// Since I don't have the file content, I cannot provide a meaningful merged code.
