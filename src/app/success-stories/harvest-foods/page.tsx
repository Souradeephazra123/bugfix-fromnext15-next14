              <h2>Client Background</h2>
              <p>
                Harvest Foods is a mid-sized food manufacturing company
                specializing in organic snacks and prepared meals. With annual
                revenue of $12 million and 45 employees, they were experiencing
                rapid growth but facing challenges with cash flow management,
                tax planning, and financial reporting.
              </p>

              <h2>The Challenge</h2>
              <p>
                When Harvest Foods approached Schapira CPA, they were dealing
                with several financial challenges:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Inconsistent cash flow affecting their ability to plan for
                  expansion
                </li>
                <li>
                  Lack of clarity around available tax incentives for food
                  manufacturers
                </li>
                <li>
                  Inefficient financial reporting processes causing delays in
                  decision-making
                </li>
                <li>
                  Uncertainty about how to structure their finances for planned
                  growth
                </li>
              </ul>

              <h2>Our Approach</h2>
